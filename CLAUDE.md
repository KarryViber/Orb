# Orb — Multi-profile AI Agent Framework

Receive messages via Slack (Discord/WeChat planned), fork Claude Code CLI to execute tasks.

## Architecture

```
src/
  main.js              — Entry point, adapter init, signal handling
  scheduler.js         — Worker lifecycle, task queue, scheduling
  config.js            — config.json loading, profile routing
  worker.js            — Fork child process, invoke Claude CLI
  cron.js              — Cron scheduled tasks (60s tick, job persistence, schedule parsing)
  context.js           — Layered prompt assembly (soul → user → directives → memory → thread → message)
  session.js           — thread↔session persistence (per-profile isolation)
  memory.js            — Holographic memory retrieval + conversation storage (via Python bridge)
  format-utils.js      — Platform-agnostic text utilities (sanitize, split)
  log.js               — Console + file dual-write, 50MB auto-rotation
  queue.js             — Global task FIFO queue
  adapters/
    interface.js       — PlatformAdapter abstract base class
    slack.js           — Slack Socket Mode implementation
    slack-format.js    — Markdown→mrkdwn, Block Kit builder
```

## Key Paths

- `profiles/{name}/scripts/`              — User utility scripts
- `profiles/{name}/workspace/`            — Claude CLI working directory (cwd per profile)
- `profiles/{name}/workspace/CLAUDE.md`   — Agent persona + runtime constraints (CLI auto-discovers from cwd)
- `profiles/{name}/workspace/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Per-profile skills (CLI auto-discovers via cwd)
- `profiles/{name}/data/`                 — sessions.json + memory.db + doc-index.db + cron-jobs.json (gitignored)
- `lib/holographic/`                      — Holographic memory engine (Python)
- `lib/docstore/`                         — DocStore file index (FTS5, Python)
- `config.json`                           — Profile routing + adapter configuration

## Prompt Architecture

Worker invokes Claude CLI with `--append-system-prompt`, letting CLI
natively inject (via auto-discovery):
- CLAUDE.md (three layers: `~/.claude`, `~/Orb/`, `{cwd}/` = workspace/)
- Skills from `{cwd}/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (per-profile via cwd)
- Agents from `~/.claude/agents/` + `{cwd}/.claude/agents/`
- Auto-memory from `~/.claude/projects/{encoded-cwd}/memory/MEMORY.md`

Orb's system-prompt contribution (appended, minimal):
- Scripts path pointer (`profile.scriptsDir`)

Orb's user-prompt layers (dynamic per-turn, injected via stream-json stdin):
- Holographic memory recall (cross-thread, trust-weighted)
- DocStore recall (project-slug scoped)
- Thread history (from platform adapter)
- Skill-review prior conversation (conditional, `mode === 'skill-review'`)
- Thread metadata + file attachments + user message

## Config

`config.json` supports `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation. SIGHUP triggers hot-reload.

## Dev

```bash
npm run dev          # --watch mode
npm start            # Production start (managed by launchd)
```

## Conventions

- ESM (type: module), Node >= 18, pure JS
- Workers are short-lived per-thread processes — forked on first message, reused for follow-up messages in the same thread via `inject` IPC, exit on idle timeout, never reused across threads
- Do not modify core files of a running Orb instance (main/scheduler/worker/adapters) — use spec files for external sessions to execute

## Cron

Jobs stored in `profiles/{name}/data/cron-jobs.json`. CronScheduler ticks every 60s, checks due jobs and forks workers to execute.

Job format:
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": "Daily Report",
  "prompt": "Generate daily report...",
  "schedule": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 9 * * *", "display": "0 9 * * *" },
  "deliver": { "platform": "slack", "channel": "C01234", "threadTs": null },
  "profileName": "default",
  "enabled": true,
  "repeat": { "times": null, "completed": 0 },
  "model": "haiku",
  "effort": "low",
  "nextRunAt": "2026-04-15T09:00:00+09:00",
  "lastRunAt": null, "lastStatus": null, "lastError": null
}
```

Optional fields:
- `"model"`: `"haiku"` | `"sonnet"` | `"opus"` (default: system default, usually opus)
- `"effort"`: `"low"` | `"medium"` | `"high"` | `"xhigh"` | `"max"` (Opus defaults xhigh)

Token tier guidelines:
| Task type | model | effort |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Script-driven / templated output | `haiku` | `low` |
| Summary / aggregation | `sonnet` | `medium` |
| Knowledge distillation / decision review | `sonnet` | `high` |
| Deep analysis / client-facing (rarely cron) | `opus` | `xhigh` |

Schedule types: `"0 9 * * *"` (cron), `"every 30m"` (interval), `"2h"` / ISO (one-shot).
Agents manage tasks by directly reading/writing cron-jobs.json (Claude CLI native file operations).

## Architecture Constraints

The following rules are invariants established during architecture evolution. Any session modifying source code must comply.

### File Responsibility Layers

| File | Reader | Responsibility | Maintenance frequency |
|------|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| `~/Orb/CLAUDE.md` (this file) | External Claude Code sessions (when modifying source) | Developer guide + architecture constraints | On architecture changes |
| `profiles/{name}/workspace/CLAUDE.md` | Claude CLI (auto-discovered from cwd) | Agent persona + runtime constraints + execution discipline | Regular maintenance |
| `profiles/{name}/soul/*.md` | — (retired) | Retired — persona merged into `workspace/CLAUDE.md` | — |
| `profiles/{name}/data/MEMORY.md` | — (retired) | Retired — CLI auto-memory (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md`) replaces it | — |

Single-layer (workspace/CLAUDE.md) + CLI auto-memory: persona, decision principles, and runtime constraints all live in `workspace/CLAUDE.md`; persistent user preferences are captured by Claude CLI's native auto-memory keyed on cwd.

### Profile Isolation

- Each profile uses independent `scripts/`, `workspace/` (with `workspace/.claude/skills/` for per-cwd skill isolation), and `data/` paths under `profiles/{name}/`
- `userIds` mapping in `config.json` determines which profile a user belongs to; unmapped `userId`s are rejected (no `default` fallback)
- Session data is isolated by `{platform}:{threadTs}` key, stored in each profile's `data/sessions.json`
- Runtime root/path validation hard-checks `workspace/` and `data/`; `scripts/` is resolved per-profile but not enforced by the same guard
- Adding a user = create profile directory + add mapping in config.json, no source code changes

### Platform Abstraction

- `adapters/interface.js` defines the `PlatformAdapter` abstract base class
- One adapter per platform (slack.js), implementing `start/disconnect/sendReply/editMessage/uploadFile/setTyping/sendApproval/buildPayloads/fetchThreadHistory`
- Platform-specific formatting in `adapters/{platform}-format.js`, shared utilities in `format-utils.js`
- `scheduler.js` operates platforms only through the adapter interface, never importing platform SDKs directly
- Adding a platform = new adapter + format file + config.json entry, no changes to scheduler/worker/context

### Worker IPC Protocol

Scheduler ↔ Worker communication via Node IPC (process.send/on('message')):

| Direction | Type | Payload | Notes |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| Scheduler → Worker | `task` | `{ type: 'task', userText, fileContent, imagePaths, threadTs, channel, userId, platform, threadHistory, profile, model, effort, mode?, priorConversation? }` | Initial task for a thread. `mode: 'skill-review'` requires `priorConversation`, which `context.js` injects as review context. |
| Scheduler → Worker | `inject` | `{ type: 'inject', userText, fileContent?, imagePaths? }` | Injects a follow-up user message into the active same-thread Claude CLI session without spawning a new worker. |
| Worker → Scheduler | `result` | `{ type: 'result', text, toolCount, lastTool?, stopReason? }` | Final payload emitted when the worker is about to exit. |
| Worker → Scheduler | `error` | `{ type: 'error', error, errorContext? }` | Terminal failure payload. |
| Worker → Scheduler | `turn_complete` | `{ type: 'turn_complete', text, toolCount, lastTool, stopReason }` | Signals that one Claude turn finished; scheduler can deliver it while keeping the worker alive for future `inject` messages. |
| Worker → Scheduler | `progress_update` | `{ type: 'progress_update', text }` | Phase ①: emitted on every TodoWrite event. Scheduler posts on first occurrence (stores `ts`), then edits in-place on subsequent ones. Does NOT set `responded` flag or clear typing. |
| Worker → Scheduler | `typing_heartbeat` | `{ type: 'typing_heartbeat', channel, threadTs }` | Phase ②: 8s pulse while Claude CLI runs. Scheduler refreshes Slack typing indicator without clearing it. Does NOT set `responded` flag. |

Adding or changing message types/payload fields requires updating `worker.js` header comment, `scheduler.js` handler, and this section together.

### Immutable Constraints

- **Claude Code CLI is the only agent runtime** — no other LLM SDKs
- **Workers are short-lived per-thread processes** — fork on first message, accept same-thread `inject` follow-ups, exit on idle timeout, never reused across threads
- **Orb runtime must not modify its own source code** — use spec files for external sessions to execute
- **config.json is the sole routing configuration source** — no hardcoded userId/profile mappings in code
